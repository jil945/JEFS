# JEFS (Just Enjoy our Food Suggestions)
Final Project for CS 225\
Requirements:
 - Node 8+

## Setup
Use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
After you have clone the repo to your machine, run the following:
```
cd JEFS
npm install
npm start #You can also use expo start
```
The Expo DevTools webpage should automatically open. If not, go to http://localhost:19002/. Follow the instructions on the webpage to view the app.

## Running the app locally on your phone
1. Download the 'Expo Client' either on the App Store or Google Play Store.
2. Using the QR code scanner on your phone, scan the QR code in the Expo DevTools webpage. 
This should automatically prompt you to open the Expo Client app (Make sure your phone and computer are on the same LAN and the connection type is set to LAN in Expo DevTools).
